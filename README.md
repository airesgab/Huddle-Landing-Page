### Hi there!

This is a simple Landing page made with HTML and CSS properties, it is mobile friendly and I have used hover features to make it more interactive and visually pleasing.

### Built with

- Semantic HTML5 markup
- CSS custom properties
- Flexbox
- Mobile-first workflow

Users should be able to:

- View the optimal layout for the page depending on their device's screen size
- See hover states for all interactive elements on the page
